# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

laughing-man is a CLI tool that turns a folder of Markdown files into a newsletter: a static archive site on Cloudflare Pages and email delivery via Resend Broadcasts. Built with Bun + TypeScript.

## Commands

```
laughing-man init              # Generate laughing-man.yaml
laughing-man setup web         # Create Cloudflare Pages project + custom domain + DNS
laughing-man setup newsletter  # Verify Resend API key + sender domain + DNS records
laughing-man build             # Validate + generate site + email HTML (excludes drafts)
laughing-man preview           # Build (including drafts) + local server with live reload
laughing-man stamp             # Add frontmatter to .md files that don't have it
laughing-man deploy            # Deploy to Cloudflare Pages via wrangler
laughing-man send <N>          # Send issue N via Resend Broadcast
laughing-man send status       # Show delivery status for all sent broadcasts
```

Install from npm: `npm install -g laughing-man-cli`
Or run without installing: `npx laughing-man-cli <command>`

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js 22+ (published package). Bun for development/testing.
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Templates:** Plain TypeScript functions returning HTML strings (no React, no JSX)
- **Email:** MJML for responsive email HTML

## Development

```bash
bun test                # Run tests
bun run typecheck       # TypeScript check
bun run build           # Compile TS + copy assets to dist/
bun src/cli.ts --help   # Run CLI locally
```

A PostToolUse hook auto-runs `bun run build` when source files are edited. If the hook is not active, run it manually after code changes to keep `dist/` in sync.

### Local CLI Testing

Run `bun link` from the project root to register the package globally. This symlinks to source, so code changes take effect immediately without re-running.

```bash
bun link                       # One-time setup
laughing-man --help            # Works from any directory
```

Re-run `bun link` after Bun upgrades or if `laughing-man` stops resolving.

### Releasing a New Version

1. Bump the version in `package.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version's changes
3. Commit the version bump and push to `main`
4. Tag the commit and push the tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v<version>
   git push origin v<version>
   ```
5. The `publish.yml` workflow runs on `v*` tags: typechecks, tests, verifies the tag matches `package.json` version, then publishes to npm with provenance via Trusted Publishing (OIDC).

## External Tool Documentation

When you need information about tools used in this project, use the `find-docs` skill or the Cloudflare skills listed below.

### Cloudflare Skills (`.claude/skills/`)

Use these skills for Cloudflare-specific work. They pull from Cloudflare docs and cover best practices.

| Skill                    | Use when                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cloudflare`             | General Cloudflare platform work (Workers, Pages, KV, D1, R2, AI) |
| `wrangler`               | Running wrangler commands, configuring `wrangler.jsonc`           |
| `workers-best-practices` | Writing or reviewing Workers/Pages Functions code                 |

### Context7 Library IDs

Pre-resolved IDs for the `find-docs` skill. Pass directly to `ctx7 docs`, skipping the `ctx7 library` step:
