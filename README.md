# laughing-man

Turn your Markdown into a newsletter.

You write Markdown files with whatever apps/tools you like (Obsidian, Logseq, VSCode, etc.). The `laughing-man` CLI builds them into a browsable archive website and send-ready email newsletter. Deploy the site to Cloudflare Pages, send issues to subscribers via Resend. Fully self-hosted and free (within Resend and Cloudflare free tiers). No CMS, no database, no code — just you and your Markdown files.

> Named after the Laughing Man from Kenji Kamiyama's _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ — an elite hacker who broadcasts information by hijacking digital perceptions across the network.

## Installation

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and a domain name.

```bash
bun add -g @sadcoder/laughing-man
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
bunx @sadcoder/laughing-man --help
```

## Usage

### Ask Your Agent

```prompt
How do I use this tool? Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sadcoderlabs/laughing-man/main/skills/laughing-man/SKILL.md
```

### Do It Yourself

Generate `laughing-man.yaml` in any folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/markdown/folder/
laughing-man init
```

Preview your newsletter website with the local server:

```bash
newsletter/
  001-your-first-issue.md
  002-another-one.md
  laughing-man.yaml

laughing-man preview
```

Set up Cloudflare Pages (project + custom domain + DNS) and deploy:

```bash
laughing-man setup web          # Create Cloudflare Pages project + custom domain + DNS
laughing-man deploy             # Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
```

Cloudflare API token permissions for `setup web`:

- `Account | Cloudflare Pages | Edit`
- `Zone | DNS | Edit` for the specific custom domain zone when `web_hosting.domain` is set

Scope the token to the specific account and, for DNS, the specific zone. Avoid `All zones` unless you intentionally want one token to manage DNS across every zone in the account.

Set up Resend and send an issue:

```bash
laughing-man setup newsletter          # Verify Resend API key + sender domain + DNS
laughing-man send <issue-number>       # Send an issue via Resend Broadcast
```

## Configurations

`laughing-man init` generates a `laughing-man.yaml` in your newsletter directory.

```yaml
