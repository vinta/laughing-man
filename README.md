Turn your Markdown into a newsletter.

You write Markdown files with whatever apps/tools you like (Obsidian, Logseq, VSCode, etc.), `laughing-man` CLI builds them into a browsable archive website and send-ready email newsletter. You deploy the site to Cloudflare Pages, send the newsletter to subscribers via Resend. Fully self-hosted and free (included in Resend free tier). No CMS, no database, no code, just you and your Markdown files.
